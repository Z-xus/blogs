This is me documenting my journey so that maybe if you want to learn about it, it is easier for you.\nDisclaimer This content is primarily relevant to India and sometimes US markets. The content here is purely for educational purposes. This is not financial advice.\nStocks Stock is basically ownership of a company.\nUsual ways that people make profit from a stock is:\nPrice appreciation: you bought it for 100 rupees, sold for 200. profit of 100 in your pocket. Dividends: company gives out profits to all owners yearly or so. But this is upto company whether they want to give away or not. Mutual Funds I growed up watching mutual funds advertisements many times, never really understood what they meant.\nA very common example used to explain it is a basket of stocks. However, I think most simple way to explain it is:\nIt is a collection of different stock (and stock like stuff). Reason for it to be a collection is so that risk is reduced.\nThis is done because investing solely in a single company is very high risk. What if one day there is some negative PR, and company stock hits rock bottom. Investing little bit in many companies will save u from this loss because profit of some other place can help you.\nYou will hear a popular saying, “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” This is what they’re talking about.\nPortfolio of a fund means which stocks they have in their collection. But your portfolio means what all of the investments you are holding.\nOne more thing u will hear is that there are stock market index funds. Think of these also as a collection of stocks.\nIn india we have two main stock indices:\nNifty-50: Top 50 companies in National Stock Exchange (NSE) Sensex: Top 30 companies in Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) A Stock exchange is basically a place where people can sell or buy stocks under some party like Govt monitoring them. Governments try to keep regulations in place so that people don’t misbehave.\nAn index is actually not a mutual fund. It is just a public list for people to know how market is doing overall.\nAny mutual fund can mimic the index. So it means they keep their investments only in Nifty 50 for example. These mutual funds are called an Index fund or ETFs.\nNow you may wonder, why they are called “mutual” funds. What happens is that many people buy a mutual fund in bulk/pool.\nSo mutual means collective ownership/sharing. This means profits and losses are equally shared among all the investors.\nWho does this?\nFunds are managed by Asset Management Companies (AMC). They have their fund managers who speculate the market for returns. Since they’re doing the heavy lifting of market research and you are just putting money in, they charge you a premium.\nThis premium is called as “Expense ratio”. A 1% expense ratio means on investing 100 rupees, you have to pay 1 rupee to the AMC every year. Lastly, you will hear types of mutual funds:\nSmall cap: invest mostly in small scale companies, high risk, high reward. Mid cap: invest mostly in medium scale companies, quite stable, medium risk, medium reward. Large cap: invest mostly in large scale companies, low risk, low reward. so, in short, small scale startups can fail easily and if they boom, they reward generously too and large scale companies stock price is table so not much amount of profit, but the stock price won’t be bouncing up and down too much.\nMetrics CAGR So if you looked at any ads for mututal funds, you must have seen a metric called CAGR.\nFull form: Compound Annual Growth Rate. Basically, it is avg growth rate on a yearly basis. Growth means how much your investment increased in value. Like buying a Tata stock which was 100 rupees now became 200, so it is 100% growth.\nLet’s say u bought a mutual fund with a CAGR of 30%. But you don’t know if the fund was really lucky that one year it growed by 150% and rest of the time with 10%.\nThe problem with only looking at one metric is that you will lose insight on other important stuff. Think of it like you need to have an idea of the bigger picture of the market to make profit consistently.\nThere are a lot of metrics like:\nSharpe ratio Sharpe is basically the ratio of return over risk. So you for example, you are given two choices of buy a house.\nHouse A will give you 100% returns i.e. double the investment. It’s a very nice sea-faced apartment. House B will give you 10% returns.\nYou would buy House A, seems like a no-brainer.\nBut if something happens one day like a tsunami or something, House A will be washed way in it. So you have the risk of losing entire investment you put in. House B is in reletively safe area, no earthquakes, no natural disasters.\nWould you still buy house A now?\nSo this is what return to risk ratio does. You know how much returns you can make but you also need to know how safe investment it is.\nBeta Measures the volatility (how much a stock jumps up or down) compared to market.\nβ = 1 → moves with market β \u003e 1 → more volatile than market β \u003c 1 → less volatile than market β \u003c 0 → moves opposite to market Capture ratio Financial Assets So I’ve been talking about stocks all the way. But there are also more types of it which are different but they work in same manner. But I think for today, just have a short overview on what they are:\n1. Equity / Stocks Ownership in a company. Profit from price appreciation and dividends. 2. Debt / Bonds Lending money to government or corporations. Earn fixed interest (aka coupon). Quite low risk, therefore low returns. 3. Cash \u0026 Cash Equivalents Bank deposits (like Fixed Deposits), money market instruments, treasury bills. Very low risk, highly liquid. 4. Derivatives Financial contracts whose value depends on an underlying asset. Examples: Futures, Options, Swaps. 5. Mutual Funds \u0026 ETFs Pooled investments in a mix of stocks, bonds, or other assets. Diversified risk. 6. Commodities Physical goods like gold, silver, oil, agricultural products. Can be invested via commodity ETFs or futures. 7. Real Estate / Property Residential, commercial, or land. Can generate rental income and capital gains. 8. Alternative Investments Hedge funds, private equity, crypto, collectibles. Typically higher risk, lower liquidity.
