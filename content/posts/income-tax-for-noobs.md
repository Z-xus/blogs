# Income Tax for Noobs

Since childhood I have seen many movies where ED used to raid into places. While growing up, I saw many people struggle with understanding this, so they either hire a CA or they just file anything and make losses. (also there may be different cases)

So I thought why not try to understand how it works to safeguard myself (and my money). While learning about it, I thought I can share the knowledge about the same, so here we are.

Since I am a salaried person like most people, I'll only discuss the same here.

## Taxable Income

Part of your income which you are obliged to pay taxes on. The taxable income will eventually decide your tax slab.

Tax slabs is just rules that if you have taxable income over let's say 7 Lakhs. then you have to pay 10% (for example) as an income tax on it.
That means 70,000 will be your income tax.

Sounds like a lot. So we have some ways to reduce the tax amount you pay. Here is where you have to grind your brain for the most part.

1. **Deductions:** Make your taxable money smaller so you pay less tax, sometimes even at a lower rate.  
2. **Rebates:** Reduce the final tax amount directly.  
3. **Exemptions:** Exclude some of your income from being taxed.

## How do you pay Income Tax

If you are a salaried person, your employer takes a cut from your salary and pays it to the govt. This is called **Tax deducted at Source (TDS)**

On the financial year end (31 March), your employer will give you a form 16, which details all the tax paid, deductions, etc from you. 

Now it is your work to calculate whether your actual liability is less or more than the TDS cut from you. In most cases it is more.

So if this is the case then you only have to file in an **Income Tax Return (ITR)** so you can make your discounts on the tax and get some money back.

In the case that your TDS was lesser than the tax that should be on you. You can pay the extra as **Self-assessment Tax**.

ITRs are for 4 types, ITR 1 to 4. We'll only see ITR 1 and 2 since those are for salaried peops.

ITR-1: For individuals with income up to ₹50 lakh from salary/pension, one house property, and other sources (like interest). No capital gains or foreign assets.

ITR-2: For individuals/HUFs not having business/professional income. Covers salary, multiple house properties, capital gains, foreign income/assets, and income above ₹50 lakh.

So this is the entire process:
1. Your employer pays salary, deducts PF/other, and TDS monthly.
2. Year ends (31 March) → employer issues **Form 16**.
3. You calculate income = Salary + other sources – exemptions – deductions.
4. You apply slab rates, add cess → find tax.
5. Compare with TDS. Pay extra if short, get refund if excess.
6. File ITR (ITR-1/2) by 31 July and e-verify.
7. Dept processes, sends intimation, refunds if due. Done.
