## Embracing Git Submodules: A Journey to a Seamless Dotfiles Setup

I had been using stow since it was simple, but I was tired of making countless number of directories. I believed there had to be a better way. and oh boy, yadm it was.
In my quest towards a perfect dotfiles setup in my Arch Linux and Neovim PDE (btw), Git submodules turned out to be hero I needed but not deserved. Here's the anecdote to what happened:

## The Challenge

Managing dotfiles is a daunting task, especially when dealing with a complex array of configurations spread across multitudes of applications and tools. Initially, I used traditional methods like stow. But, as my setup kept evolving, I needed an even more sophisticated solution to handle not just my primary dotfiles but also various submodules, such as for Neovim.

## Discovering Git Submodules

All I heard about submodules was the scary stories of how messy it can get. However, Git submodules are a powerful feature that allows you to include and manage repositories within a repository. This feature became a game-changer in my quest for a cleaner setup. Here’s why:

### **1. Seamless Integration**

Using Git submodules, I could integrate external repositories directly into my dotfiles repository. For e.g, integrating a Neovim configuration repository as a submodule meant that updates to plugins or configurations could be managed seamlessly without disrupting the primary dotfiles setup.

### **2. Simplified Updates**

Managing updates with Git submodules turned out to be straightforward. With commands like `git submodule update --init --recursive`, I could ensure that all submodules were initialized and up-to-date with just a single command. This eliminated the need for manual updates and checks, saving time and reducing errors.

### **3. Enhanced Organization**

By organizing my configurations into separate repositories and including them as submodules, I achieved a cleaner, more modular setup. This approach made it easier to maintain and update each component individually while keeping the main repository organized.

## The Transition to `yadm`

The journey didn’t stop with Git submodules. I transitioned to using `yadm` (Yet Another Dotfiles Manager), which enhanced the management of my dotfiles even further. Here’s how `yadm` fit into the picture:

### **1. Advanced Dotfiles Management**

`yadm` offered advanced features tailored for dotfiles management. It provided built-in support for handling dotfiles repositories and their submodules. With commands like `yadm clone`, `yadm pull`, and `yadm submodule update`, I could effortlessly manage and synchronize my dotfiles across systems.

### **2. Automation and Consistency**

Initially, it felt very taxating to think of yadm as a substitue for git with dotfiles controlling power, but after around 20 or so minutes, I was convinced that this the way I wanted to manage my dotfiles all along. No sucky symlinks, no confusion, just a simple repo which stores what I need to store without the agressive .gitignore in my home directory. Incorporating `yadm` into my Ansible playbook automated the setup process. The playbook cloned the dotfiles repository, executed a bootstrap script, and ensured that all submodules were initialized and updated. This automation ensured consistency across setups, reducing manual intervention and potential configuration drift.

### **3. Streamlined Configuration**

Using `yadm` streamlined the configuration of my system. It handled the intricacies of managing dotfiles and submodules, allowed me to focus on enhancing my development environment rather than wrestling with configuration issues. If you read it so far, I think you should give it a fair try, it will be worth it.

## Conclusion

Embracing Git submodules and `yadm` has been a transformative experience. It has simplified the management of my dotfiles, improved organization, and enhanced the automation of my system setup. For anyone dealing with complex dotfiles setups or seeking a more efficient way to manage configurations, exploring Git submodules and `yadm` is highly recommended.

This journey has not only refined my setup but also highlighted the power of leveraging the right tools for the task at hand. The integration of Git submodules into my workflow stands as a testament to how thoughtful tooling choices can lead to a more streamlined and enjoyable development experience.
